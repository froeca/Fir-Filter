# Fir-Filter

**Introduction:**  This repository covers the design of a 32-tap FIR filter designed using VHDL to be implemented on a Xilinx Spartan 6. Data is processed sequentially, rather than in parallel, to reduce hardware demand. Made in fulfillment with ENGR 435 class requirements. For more information on the theory and implementation see the [project report](https://github.com/froeca/Fir-Filter/blob/main/Froelich_Lab5_Report_ENGR435.pdf). [Timing](https://github.com/froeca/Fir-Filter/tree/main/Timing-Diagrams), [state](https://github.com/froeca/Fir-Filter/tree/main/State-Diagram), and [block diagrams](https://github.com/froeca/Fir-Filter/tree/main/Block-Diagrams) are also provided.

**Credits:** The FIR Filter design utilizes two VHDL modules designed by Dr. Larry Aamodt; a ADC driver and a DAC driver. The VHDL descriptions can be found on [his website](https://gab.wallawalla.edu/~larry.aamodt/engr435/index.html) and are his intellectual property.

**Status of My Project:** The design was implemented on a Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA and tested in the lab to verify correct operation. As of June 6th 2021, the circuit is working as intended.

**Contact Information:** I hope this information helps give you a bit of inspiration as you work on your FIR filter design. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me by email at: Caleb.Froelich@wallawalla.edu. All the best in your electronics endeavors!
